                <p>“We can’t wait to be a part of the Sage Creek community. Knowing how quickly the community is growing and how it’s

                the confidence they deserve,” adds Pollock.</p>

                <p><a href="https://sagecreekmassagetherapy.ca/" target="_blank">Sage Creek Massage Therapy</a>has been providing residents with massage services since 2016 out of registered massage therapist Olga Beloconi’s home
                clinic at 421 Sage Creek Boulevard. The business has become a well-known practice within the community and with its
                success, has outgrown its current location.</p>
                <p>This year Beloconi will be taking Sage Creek Massage Therapy to the next level by moving into the Village Centre once
                their building is complete. Residents can enjoy a variety of massages from relaxation, deep tissue, sports, myofascial,
                reflexology, and hot stone massages to name a few, with many more coming soon.</p>
                <p>“Our goal is to bring long lasting feelings of well-being to the community, says Beloconi, owner of Sage Creek Massage
                Therapy. “We do this by helping our clients live their healthiest lives through the use of massage therapy and physical
                activity to relieve pain.”</p>

                What is an SCRA Membership
            </h3>
            <p>An SCRA membership essentially provides you a vote at the Annual General Meeting and discounts with local businesses!</p>
            <article>
                <h4>Why does the SCRA sell HOUSEHOLD memberships?</h4>
                <p>As part of our fundraising efforts to put on events and contribute in other ways to the community, we sell household
                memberships. Your purchase of a membership helps fund the newsletter, the SCRA website, events and activities (Canada
                Day, Tricks or Treats on the Trails) which helps ensure we can continue to put on fun events for the community.</p>

            <p>The SCRA is a group of volunteers that is proud to be working to make Sage Creek the best neighbourhood to live in. We
            know that there are others out there who have some time, specific skills, connections, or expertise that may make us an
            even stronger group of individuals.</p>
            <p>There are plenty of opportunities to get involved, and the time commitment is totally up to you. Please let us know if
            you are interested in helping with events, planning, writing proposals, lobbying officials, helping with fundraising or
            by taking part in any of the committees we have looking at operations, parks, schools, social activities, or
            fundraising. There are plenty of opportunities to join one of the committees and assist the Chair in the delivery of its
            objectives.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your interest in volunteering for the Sage Creek Residents’ Association! All of our events are run by
            great volunteers and we appreciate you taking the time to contact us in this regard. Please complete the information
